# Narivia

This is the first version I made of Narivia, as a for-fun and for-learning project, without any long-term, bigger plans.

It was written in Visual Basic using the XNA framework.

## Status

I just uploaded the files as I found them collecting dust and taking up my storage space.

I don't know if the project builds or not.

In the future I may take a look at it and do any necessary fixes to get it working on modern versions of VS and to make it use MonoGame instead of XNA.

I will, however, not develop it anymore, and any code change that might appear will be purely for maintenance (as stated above).

There are also some duplicated and/or redundant files that I will have to clean.
